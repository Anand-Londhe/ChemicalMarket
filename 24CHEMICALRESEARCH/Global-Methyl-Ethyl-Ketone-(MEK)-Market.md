Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), also known as 2-Butanone, is a colorless, volatile liquid with a pleasant pungent odor. It has the chemical formula C4H8O and is widely used as a solvent due to its ability to dissolve various synthetic resins, gums, cellulose acetate, and cellulose nitrate. MEK plays a critical role in industries such as paints and coatings, adhesives, printing inks, and chemical processing.
Market Size
The global Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) market was valued at approximately USD 1,382 million in 2023 and is projected to decline slightly to USD 1,297.33 million by 2032, exhibiting a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -0.01%.
In North America, the MEK market size was estimated at USD 355.80 million in 2023 and is expected to follow a similar trend with a -0.01% CAGR from 2024 through 2032.
