The global petcoke gasification market was valued at USD 448.70 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 720.31 million by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 5.40%.
Petcoke gasification is a process that converts petroleum coke (petcoke), a byproduct of oil refining, into syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). This syngas can be used to generate electricity, produce hydrogen, or serve as feedstock for chemicals and fuels. The process involves reacting petcoke with oxygen and steam under high temperatures, breaking down the carbon structure into useful gaseous components. It is a viable solution for utilizing heavy residues from refineries, reducing waste, and promoting energy efficiency.
